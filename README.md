🛠️ **Solving John Crickett's Coding Challenges in Go**

This repository contains my solutions to John Crickett's challenges. Each challenge focuses on creating a tool that performs a specific task, implemented in Go.


## 📜 Solved Challenges

### 1. [Cut Challenge](./cut)
   - A Go implementation of the `cut` Unix command.
   - Supports selecting portions of each line from a file based on field numbers and delimiters.
   - **Features**:
